# ArgumentParser
If you have read the Chapter 14 of Uncle Bob's Clean Code, you probably want to implement your solution as well.

Although you should practice TDD on your own, this repo provides thorough tests to valid your final program.

## How do I implement and test a solution?
1. Subclass `base.Args`
2. Implement your solution
3. Run `./gradlew test -DargsClass={package.yourClass}`

## How do I add more tests?
If you think some test cases are missing, feel free to create a PR and add them.

## How do I contribute a solution?
If you're proud of your own solution, we like to see your code as well. Just add them under src/main/java/solutions/{yourname} and submit a PR.
